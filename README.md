# Interview Question

This is the code I produced for a coding question prompted to me. It was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 lts.

To compile, clone this git repo to a linux machine and simply run "make".

To run, you can get the tool tip by running "./interview", and you can run the program by executing "./interview \<infile\> \<regex/swear file\> \<outfile\>"
