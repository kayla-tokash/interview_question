# Interview Question

This is the code I produced for a coding question prompted to me. It was developed and tested on Ubuntu 16.04 lts. It was also tested on Ubuntu 18.04 lts.

To compile, clone this git repo to a linux machine and simply run "cmake . && make".

To run, you can get the tool tip by running "./interview", and you can run the program by executing "./interview \<infile\> \<regex/dirty words file\> \<outfile\>"
