Can we forge against these enemies a grand and global alliance, North and South, East and West, that can assure a more fruitful life for all mankind? Will you join in that effort?

In the long of the world, only a few generations have been granted the role of defending freedom in its hour of maximum danger. I do not shrink from this responsibility — I welcome it. I do not believe that any of us would exchange places with any other people or any other generation. The energy, the faith, the devotion which we bring this endeavor will light our country and all who serve it — and the glow from that fire can truly light the world.

And so, my fellow Americans: not what your country can do for you — what you can do for your country.

My fellow citizens of the world: not what America will do for you, but what we can do for the freedom of man.
